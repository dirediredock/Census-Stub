# Census-Stub
Invariant descriptors capture key network structures, addressing challenges like the “hairball phenomenon” in node-link views. We introduce BFS-Census, which computes Census-Node, Census-Edge, and Census-Stub. Census-Stub offers unmatched discerning power without major trade-offs. New Hop-Census and Census-Census plots highlight topology change.
